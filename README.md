# **Refactoring Katas Repository**

This repository contains four popular refactoring katas, designed to help you practice and improve your coding and refactoring skills. Each kata focuses on real-world scenarios, challenging you to identify design issues and refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and functionality.

## **Included Katas**

### 1. **[Gilded Rose Kata](./gilded-rose-kata/README.md)**
- Focus: Working with legacy code and understanding complex logic.
- **Scenario**: Refactor the Gilded Rose inventory management system while maintaining its behavior.
- **Key Skills**:
    - Scanning for code smells (e.g., long methods, deep nesting).
    - Refactoring safely with comprehensive tests.
    - Making design improvements incrementally.
- **How to Run**:
    - Use the Gradle commands in the [Gilded Rose Readme](./gilded-rose-kata/README.md).

### 2. **[Parrot Refactoring Kata](./parrot/README.md)**
- Focus: Replacing type code with polymorphism and using refactoring tools effectively.
- **Scenario**: Simplify the `Parrot` class by refactoring repeated switch statements into polymorphic behavior.
- **Key Skills**:
    - Refactoring switch statements to subclasses.
    - Using factory methods for object creation.
    - Incrementally improving design with safe, automated refactorings.
- **Techniques**:
    - Push members down into subclasses.
    - Replace constructor calls with factory methods.
    - Make small, safe commits.

### 3. **[Tennis Refactoring Kata](./tennis/README.md)**
- Focus: Tidying up poorly designed code under time constraints.
- **Scenario**: Improve the design of a tennis scoring system while ensuring the provided tests still pass.
- **Key Skills**:
    - Working with comprehensive, fast tests.
    - Extracting methods to improve clarity.
    - Refactoring under real-world constraints.
- **Discussion Points**:
    - Value of refactoring beyond billable hours.
    - How comprehensive tests impact your confidence while refactoring.

### 4. **[Theatrical Players Kata](./theatrical-players/README.md)**
- Focus: Following Martin Fowler’s refactoring principles.
- **Scenario**: Refactor a system that generates customer statements for theatrical performances, splitting calculation logic from formatting logic.
- **Key Skills**:
    - Adding approval tests to legacy code.
    - Extracting methods to simplify long methods.
    - Replacing temporary variables with queries.
    - Producing output in multiple formats (e.g., text and HTML).
- **Challenge**:
    - Understand Martin Fowler’s refactoring process by replicating his steps from the book.

## **About Refactoring Katas**
Refactoring katas are small exercises designed to help developers practice improving code quality. Each kata is a self-contained scenario that encourages developers to identify design smells, refactor incrementally, and create cleaner, more maintainable code.

### **Why Practice Refactoring Katas?**
- **Improve Legacy Code Skills**: Learn how to handle poorly designed or untested codebases.
- **Master Automated Refactorings**: Use IDE tools and techniques to make safe changes.
- **Build Confidence**: Practice in a safe environment with comprehensive tests.
- **Collaborative Learning**: These katas are great for pair programming or coding dojos.
